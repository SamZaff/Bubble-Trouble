I used intellij as an IDE with java version 10.0.02. To run the game, you need to clone the project onto
an IDE and use a compiler to run it. The working directory is csc413-secondgame-samzaff13\Bubble Trouble\BubbleTrouble.
The controls are as follows:

Player 1:

Move left: A
Move right: D
Shoot: Space Bar

Player 2:

Move left: left arrow
Move right: right arrow
Shoot: enter

The second player's controls only apply when in 2-player mode. You can also pause the game at any point just
by pressing the escape button.

POWER UPS (applied when a player shoots the optional star bubbles):

Shuriken(BLUE STAR): Changes player's weapon to a fast moving shuriken

HookTrap(RED STAR): Changes to hook weapon, but will convert to a line of spikes when
 		    hitting the ceiling that will pop the next the next bubble it touches

NormalHook(GREEN STAR): Changes weapon to default hook
